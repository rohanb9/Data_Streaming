-----------------------------------------------
PROJECT 1] Optimize Chicago Public Transit
-----------------------------------------------

In this project, students will stream public transit status, using Kafka and the Kafka ecosystem, to build a stream processing application that shows the status of buses and trains in real time. Students will learn how to have their own Python code produce events, use REST Proxy to send events over HTTP, and set up Kafka Connect to collect data from a Postgres database. Finally, students will utilize the Faust Python Stream Processing library to transform station data. 


-----------------------------------------------
PROJECT 2] Analyze San Francisco Crime Rate
-----------------------------------------------

In this project, students will analyze a real-world dataset of the SF Crime Rate, extracted from Kaggle, to provide statistical analysis using Apache Spark Structured Streaming. Students will use a Kafka server to produce data, and ingest it through Spark Structured Streaming. Then, students will use various APIs to create and execute logics. You will create an ETL pipeline that produces Kafka data, ingest the data through Spark, and generate reports from the data.
